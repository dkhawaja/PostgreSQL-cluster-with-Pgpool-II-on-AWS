This page serves as documentation for setting up a highly available PostgreSQL server with pgpool-II for load balancing and watchdog on AWS. 
I've also hosted this on github pages. Check it out at https://dkhawaja.github.io/PostgreSQL-cluster-with-Pgpool-II-on-AWS/



In addition, I'm currently working on creating an automated script for the setup process. If you're interested in contributing to the project, please feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
